# Android-App-Malware-Detector
Most of the antivirus in the market use Signature-based malware detection, so they fail in preventing newly developed malware. The purpose of this project is to design a Neural Network that could determine the probability of an Android Application having a malware inside it. Since the neural network is trained on thousands of existing Android applications, it can successfully predict the possibility of any new application having a malware even if the malware is newly developed.
#Feature Extraction
Every app project will have an AndroidManifest.xml file (with precisely that name) at the root of the project source set. The manifest file describes essential information about the app to the Android build tools, the Android operating system, and Google Play. AndroidManifest.xml consists of information regarding Permissions
requested, Hardware features used, Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, Content
Provider, Meta data, Providers etc.,
Most of this information is extracted from the Xml file and used as features for
the training the Artificial Neural Network. On the other hand, classes.dex, which is now
in the form of .smali, is also used as features. Classes.dex contains all the Api calls of the
Android Application. Any Harmful or Potentially Dangerous calls indicate the possibility
of malware and hence it is an important feature.
