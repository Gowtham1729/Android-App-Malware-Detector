# Android-App-Malware-Detector
Most of the antivirus in the market use Signature-based malware detection, so they fail in preventing newly developed malware. The purpose of this project is to design a Neural Network that could determine the probability of an Android Application having a malware inside it. Since the neural network is trained on thousands of existing Android applications, it can successfully predict the possibility of any new application having a malware even if the malware is newly developed.
